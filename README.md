Hello my name is Nathaniel Poulter
Curently studying materials engineering.  
I also enjoy practicing on other engineering related skills like electronics, machining/fabrication, and various programming languages.
Most of my projects end up being tools for other projects(unless its somebody elses project) so its all about the process and adding new tools and skills to my arsenal.
